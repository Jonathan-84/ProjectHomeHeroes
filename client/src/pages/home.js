        with Choregasboard. Best yet, this is without needing to buy an expensive subscription. 
        <br>
        </br>Just add the chores for your children, assign a value, and watch how excited they are to complete their task(s). 
        Completing these tasks will add points, like an allowance, these points can then be redeemed for the rewards that matter to them. 
        This is a great way to teach your children the value of hard work and saving.
        <br>
        </br>
        In addition, you can also add penalties for "unexpected" behavior to help your child break those bad habits.
